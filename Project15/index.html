				<p class="center">A NEW HOPE FOR BLOGS</p>
				
				<p>I'm a programmer, technologist and a lover of all things digital.</p>
				
				<p> I live on the south coast of England and run my own technology company Digital Prompt.</p>
				
				<p>Ever since I can remember I have always been interested in solving problems and I’ve always had a slightly odd obsession for simplicity. When I first started in the industry it was this notion of creating the most elegant and simplest solution possible that inspired me to become better at my craft and it’s still the reason why I love what I do.</p>
				
				<p>In my downtime I’m a lover of books, lifting weights, gigs, festivals and a cheeky drink for Christmas. I love old Kung-fu movies and I’m addicted to ice lollies!</p>
				
				<p>I have been working as a professional developer for over 8 years.  I take on projects dealing with content managed websites, desktop applications and mobile development.</p>
				
				<p>My clients are mainly design agencies and small business owners who have a project or an idea and need help turning it into a reality. Sometime I work as a lone wolf but the majority of the time I play well with others.</p>
				
				<p>I love designing elegant and simple code and it is one of the reasons I love my job.  My work is always delivered on-time or ahead of schedule and it’s my job to ensure you never have to deal with ugly inflexible code again.</p>
